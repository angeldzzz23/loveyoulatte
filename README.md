Redesign website of my favorite coffee shop. 

The task is to (1) develop a single-page website for your favorite small business in LA and (2) deploy it online. Please make sure to include a note on your website that it is an unofficial webpage for the small business; if this small business already has a website, please submit your own personal redesign or reimagination of that website instead of duplicating the existing one.

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total
